description: Hack for Good is a 2-day event bringing folks together to work on projects that support our community. Progress on projects will be presented in a science fair format at the conclusion of the event. This is a different kind of hackathon. No competition, no award money; just bringing people together to learn, make connections, and build something awesome!
